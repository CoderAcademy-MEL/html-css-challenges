- A bio page showing an unordered list of the band members with photo, name and instrument/role of each.
- A nav bar with links to the 3 pages.
- A heading on each page to indicate which page it is.
  - Homepage heading should be the name of the band, with a sub-heading saying "Tribute Site" or similar

### Challenge 5

Create a page with a navbar (with a height of 60px) and a container (with a height of 100vh) underneath the navbar.

You'll need to look up CSS `calc` for an elegant solution in making sure the page doesn't scroll at all.

Once you solve that implement a similar `box-shadow` on the navbar, style the links and ensure that the message in the container is perfectly centered on the page using flexbox.

### Challenge 6

Create a similar form to the image below (with a username, password and submit button) using flexbox. 

Think about what you'll use for your `flex-direction`. Centre the form in the middle of the page.

This is a tricky task that will require a lot of flexbox. Start simple. Think about the individual components the layout might be using.

The top navbar with text could be its own flexbox. The filter section could be its own flexbox. The cards could also be their own flexbox 🤯. 

The card section is a tough one. Think about making your flex children have the `width` and your inner card can take the `height` and `margin`.

Here is the result of some code I wrote that demonstrates a bare bones setup for the goal layout. Let me know if you have questions.

### Challenge 10

This is the challenge we'll be completing [throughout most of Monday](http://www.csszengarden.com/) and early Tuesday. Read through the documentation and look at some of the examples before you start.

Put simply, the task is to download the HTML template that's provided and implement your own styling 🎨. If you're proud of your work I'd love for you to demo it to the class on Tuesday next week!

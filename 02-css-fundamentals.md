### Challenge 3

Create a website that has a fixed navigation like the image below. By fixed navigation I mean that the navigation bar will always display and the content below it will scroll underneath.

The links should allow you to jump to different points on the page. You'll need to use an `id` for this.

### Challenge 5

#### Overview

We'll be creating multiple button, card, badge and label components to make a reusable library of different components.

#### Specs

Firstly, go find some components that inspire you. I like to use [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/popular/web-design) for inspiration.  

Secondly, implement these designs in raw HTML and CSS.

#### To do
- 3 button designs
- 2 card designs
- 2 badge designs
- 2 alert designs 

For more information on what these components might look like check out the [Bootstrap library](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/alerts/).

You'll end up with something like the below.

Use the `@import` syntax for these components. So you'll end up having a `style.css` that imports `button.css`, `card.css`, `badge.css` and `alert.css`

### Challenge 7

**Overview**

In this challenge you'll be playing with media queries.

**Part 1**

Create a page with a full width and full height blue background.

When the page is less than 600px make it have a red background.

**Part 2**

Create another HTML page.

At mobile view (less than 600px) have just one item in navbar, a logo (can just be a 50px by 50px circle) that's centre aligned and links somewhere.

At a bigger view make the navbar have 4 different links. Have the logo left aligned and 4 different links right aligned.

### Challenge 8
- Read through chapters 4 to 6 of the [interneting is hard documentation](https://internetingishard.com).

### Challenge 9
- Build a responsive website using media queries
- Create a site about your favorite recipe
- You may use whichever layout and styling you please, but it must be fully mobile responsive (for both phone and tablet)
- It must contain the following:
  - An image of the dish
  - List of ingredients
  - Instructions for preparing the dish
- Compare your website to the [web accessibility checklist](https://a11yproject.com/checklist/), and work out how to make it more accessible

#### Optional 

Complete all of the [freecodecamp basic css challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/basic-css/).

### Challenge 2

Create a landing page like the image below.

You'll need to research some new CSS properties like `background` and `background-size`.

Also attempt to use `linear-gradient` with the background property.

### Challenge 3

Create a website that has a fixed navigation like the image below. By fixed navigation I mean that the navigation bar will always display and the content below it will scroll underneath.

The links should allow you to jump to different points on the page. You'll need to use an `id` for this. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6XGCOI-IDY&feature=youtu.be) to visually see the behavior we're looking for.

### Challenge 5

#### Overview

We'll be creating multiple button, card, badge and label components to make a reusable library of different components.

#### Specs

Firstly, go find some components that inspire you. I like to use [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/popular/web-design) for inspiration.  

Secondly, implement these designs in raw HTML and CSS.

#### To do
- 3 button designs
- 2 card designs
- 2 badge designs
- 2 alert designs 

For more information on what these components might look like check out the [Bootstrap library](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/alerts/).

You'll end up with something like the below.

Use the `@import` syntax for these components. So you'll end up having a `style.css` that imports `button.css`, `card.css`, `badge.css` and `alert.css`

### Challenge 7

This challenge will require the use of media queries.

a. 
- Create a page with a single `div` in the `body`, the div should be have a width of 100vw and a height of 100vh, it should also have a blue background
- When the page is less than 600px in width make it have a red background

b.
- Create a page with a navbar, the navbar should extend the full width of the page and it should have a height of 50px, give it a border of 1px solid black so you can see it
- At mobile view (less than 600px) have just one item in navbar; a logo (can just be a 50px by 50px circle) 
- The logo should be horizontally and vertically centre aligned in the nav, it should also link somewhere (can just be google)
- At a bigger view (more than 600px) make the navbar have 4 different links plus still displaying the logo, the links should have a font-size of 30px and have a left and right margin of 10px 
- Make the logo left aligned and the 4 different links right aligned inside of the nav
- It should look something like this https://youtu.be/ClDK4xpDlAY

### Challenge 8
- Read through chapters 4 to 6 of the [interneting is hard documentation](https://internetingishard.com).

### Challenge 9

- It must contain the following:
  - An image of the dish
  - List of ingredients
  - Instructions for preparing the dish
- Compare your website to the [web accessibility checklist](https://a11yproject.com/checklist/), and work out how to make it more accessible

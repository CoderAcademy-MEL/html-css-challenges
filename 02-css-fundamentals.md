### Challenge 5

**Overview**

We'll be creating multiple button, card, badge and label components to make a reusable library of different components.

**Specs**

Firstly, go find some components that inspire you. I like to use [Apple's Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/) or [Google's Material Design](https://material.io/design/).  

Secondly, recreate or remix these components in Figma.

Lastly, implement these designs in raw HTML and CSS.

**To do**
- 3 buttons designs
- 2 card designs
- 2 label designs
- 1 badge design 

You'll end up with something like the below.

### Challenge 7

**Overview**

In this challenge you'll be playing with media queries.

**Part 1**

Create a page with a full width and full height blue background.

When the page is less than 600px make it have a red background.

**Part 2**

Create another HTML page.

At mobile view (less than 600px) have just one item in navbar, a logo (can just be a 50px by 50px circle) that's centre aligned and links somewhere.

At a bigger view make the navbar have 4 different links. Have the logo left aligned and 4 different links right aligned.

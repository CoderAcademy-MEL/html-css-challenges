## Make a webpage to sell your terminal app ðŸš€! 

Your objective is to build a webpage implementing all the new CSS features we've learnt this week like flexbox.

You should structure your website into smaller components similar to what Aaron demonstrated today.

You will only use HTML and CSS to do this project (no JavaScript).

Here are the things your webpage needs to have:
- Product (your terminal app) landing page should have a header element with a corresponding `id="header"`
- The header should have a logo of your company
-  Within the header element there should be a nav element with a corresponding `id="nav-bar"`
- The nav element should have at least three clickable items each within a "nav-link" class
- Clicking a `.nav-link` button in the nav element, user will be taken to the corresponding section of the landing page
- Use embedded video to show how your terminal app works with a corresponding `id="video"`
- Add a form element with a corresponding `id="form"`
- Within the form add an input field with `id="email"`
- The email input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for
- The email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address
- Within the form, add a submit input with a corresponding `id="submit"`
- The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport
- Add media queries(at least one) so that the landing page fits your mobile screen as well

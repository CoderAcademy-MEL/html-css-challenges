## Make a webpage to sell your terminal app ðŸš€! 

Your objective is to build a webpage implementing all the new CSS features we've learnt this week like flexbox.

You should structure your website into smaller components similar to what Aaron demonstrated today.

You will only use HTML and CSS to do this project.

Here are the things your webpage needs to have:

1. Design a navbar
-  There should be a nav element with a corresponding `id="navbar"`
- The nav element should have at least three clickable items each within a `"nav-link"` class
- Use font awesome to pick out an icon to use as a logo, change it's default color and size
- Add a custom font using google fonts

2. Design a "features" section
- Your site should have a card layout for "features of your terminal app", this should use flexbox
- Within each card you should have some lorem ipsum text, this would be where you'd discuss the features of your app
- Add media queries (at least one) so that the landing page fits your mobile screen as well

3. Design a contact me form
- Add a form element with a corresponding `id="form"`
- Within the form add an input field with `id="email"`
- The email input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for
- The email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address
- Within the form, add a submit input with a corresponding `id="submit"`

4. Make the navbar fixed so that content can scroll under it, you should be able to test this out in mobile view

5. Clicking a `.nav-link` button in the nav element, the user will be taken to the corresponding section of the landing page

6. Add a gallery section for your terminal app, this would contain images of the app in action, to get nice screen shots on MacOS use the `command-shift-4` + `spacebar` trick.

7. Add a footer html element at the bottom of the page with your contact details and links to your social accounts.

<h2>This is a page about a band I was listening to upstairs. They are crusty old Britons who play rather too many tracks that are just sort of howling around a mandolin and probably a campfire but I still bloody love them.<br><br></h2>

  Sorry, that font was likely very difficult to read.
  Anyway this page is about Led Zeppelin and here's a pic that I googled of them including the term "royalty free", but I didn't actually check the rights so I just deep-fried the pic to cover myself. I'm sure Google can see right through it.<br><br>

  <p>(c) 2020 Sal. This is pretty much the equivalent of a "Hello World" in html so go ahead and steal it.<br>
  I'm pretty sure the main pic is from Rolling Stone. But considering the band hated Rolling Stone mag for their bad review of their first album, I'm just gonna go ahead and attribute it to Getty, which it was also on.
  All other pics are from wikipedia and are hence public domain. Also easily found.
